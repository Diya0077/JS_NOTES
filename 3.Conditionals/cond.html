   <b> Why Learn Conditionals?</b><br>
<br> Conditionals are essential for decision-making in programming. 
<br> They allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.
<br> The main conditional statements in JavaScript are:
<br> - if
<br> - else-if
<br> - else
<br>1: Simple if statement
<br>The 'if' statement executes a block of code if the condition is true.
<br>2: if-else statement
<br>The 'else' block executes if the 'if' condition is false.
<br>3: if-else-if statement
<br> The 'else-if' block allows us to test multiple conditions.
<br>4: Nested if statement
<br>We can also nest 'if' statements within other 'if' blocks for more complex conditions.
<br>5: Using logical operators with conditionals
<br>Combining multiple conditions using logical operators (&& for AND, || for OR).
<br>6: Using the ternary operator for concise conditionals
<br> The ternary operator is a shorthand for if-else statements.
<br>7: Switch statement (alternative to if-else chains)
<br>The 'switch' statement allows us to handle multiple conditions more efficiently.
