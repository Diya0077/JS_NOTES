   <h1> Why learn variable, let, const?</h1>
 <br>These keywords are used to declare variables in JavaScript. <br>Understanding their differences is crucial for writing predictable and maintainable code.<br>
<b> var:</b><br>
 1. Function-scoped: The scope of a var variable is limited to the function where it is declared.<br>
 2. Can be re-declared and updated.<br>
 3. Does not enforce block-level scope, which can lead to unexpected results.<br>
 <b>let:</b><br>
 1. Block-scoped: The scope is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is used.<br>
 2. Cannot be re-declared in the same scope but can be updated.<br>
<b> const:</b><br>
 1. Block-scoped, like let.<br>
 2. Cannot be re-declared or updated once assigned.<br>
 3. Useful for declaring constants or variables that should not change.<br>
